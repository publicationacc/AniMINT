AniMINT is a dataset for evaluating whether vision language models (VLMs) can understand **UI animations** beyond static screenshots.

Modern user interfaces use animations to communicate feedback, state changes, progress, warnings, affordances, and other interaction-relevant information. AniMINT provides a dataset for studying how well multimodal models perceive, categorize, and interpret these dynamic UI signals.

## Dataset Overview

AniMINT contains **300 densely annotated UI animation videos** collected from mobile, web, and desktop interfaces.

Each video is annotated with:

- start and end frame of the animation;
- animation region of interest(s);
- UI context;
- user input or triggering action, when applicable;
- 10 unique human-annotated, open-ended descriptions of the animation effect;
- 10 unique human-annotated, open-ended descriptions of the animation meaning;
- categorization of animation purpose.

    "The application is meant to turn on dark mode instead of light mode. The colors and theme get darker and the changing graphics represent that. To turn on dark mode, the user clicks the button and the nighttime scene comes up. To go back to light mode, they click the button again and the sunny daytime scene appears instead."

## Annotation Types

### Animation Purpose Labels

Each animation is assigned one expert-labeled purpose category.

AniMINT uses seven purpose categories:

| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| `Transition` | Supports a layout, screen, or state change in the interface. |
| `Demonstration` | Reveals or explains the behavior, functionality, or structure of an interface element. |
| `Guidance` | Guides the user toward an intended interaction. |
| `Feedback` | Provides a visual response to user input or system action. |
| `Visualization` | Represents system status, data, progress, or other information. |
| `Highlight` | Draws attention to specific content or an interface element. |
| `Aesthetic` | Enhances visual appeal or emotional experience without primarily conveying required information. |

Purpose label distribution:

| Purpose | Count | Percentage |
|---|---:|---:|
| `Visualization` | 114 | 38.00% |
| `Transition` | 45 | 15.00% |
| `Feedback` | 40 | 13.33% |
| `Highlight` | 39 | 13.00% |
| `Guidance` | 26 | 8.67% |
| `Demonstration` | 20 | 6.67% |
| `Aesthetic` | 16 | 5.33% |

### Animation Effect Descriptions

Each video includes **10 unique human-written open-ended descriptions of the animation effect**.

These annotations describe what visually happens in the animation, such as an element shaking, a progress ring filling, an icon bouncing, a button fading, or a panel sliding. They focus on the perceptual and motion-level properties of the animation.

### Animation Meaning Descriptions

Each video includes **10 unique human-written open-ended descriptions of the animation’s meaning**.

These annotations describe what the animation communicates in context, such as an error, progress, confirmation, warning, loading state, guidance cue, or system response. Because UI animation interpretation can be subjective, AniMINT preserves multiple independent human annotations instead of reducing each video to a single reference answer.
